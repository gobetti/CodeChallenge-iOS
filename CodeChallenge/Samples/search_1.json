What incredible forces created this man, the world’s greatest killing machine? For years, Wolverine has searched desperately for answers from his past, from the wilds of the Canadian wilderness to the teeming cities of Japan and beyond. And despite his perseverance and longing for the truth, he remains an enigma to himself and those around him. But, in this landmark event, Marvel reveals all: The birth and childhood of young James Howlett…the intriguing secrets of his family history…and the tragedy that changed everything.

On the road, unforeseen revelations strike as hilarious or heartbreaking, rarely in between.

ORIGIN STORY is a deeply personal but universally relevant tale of immigration, conflict, addiction, and personal responsibility.
